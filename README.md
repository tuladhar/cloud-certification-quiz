## ChatGPT Prompt to Create Logo  logo

```
Design a minimalist logo inspired by a cloud theme, representing cloud technology and achievement. The logo should feature a soft, rounded white cloud shape as the main element. Inside the cloud, include a square or rounded square with a light blue background and a bold yellow checkmark, outlined in dark blue or black, symbolizing completion or correctness. Use flat design principles with clean, modern aesthetics. Ensure the overall color palette includes white, light blue, yellow, and dark blue for a professional and approachable feel. The design should be simple, scalable, and versatile, suitable for a cloud certification quiz app.
